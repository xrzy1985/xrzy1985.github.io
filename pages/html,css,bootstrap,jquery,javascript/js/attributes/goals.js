		<b id="shade">A little about me</b>, I'm not sure if I am your typical computer programmer, but I am definitely
		me. I love to exercise, and in return that leads me to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I like to go hiking, biking,
		or jogging along the country side in my free time. I also spend at least thirty minutes a day to play guitar, and
		learn a new chord, progression, or scale. The goal every day is to learn something new, challenge myself in different
		ways, and hopefully I will be a better person come tomorrow.
	
		<br><br>
	
		<b id="shade">The 1<sup>st</sup> goal</b> is to obtain an entry level position within a great company.
		I took a year off to travel, and since I've been back in the states I haven't found the perfect fit. I
		want to secure a job with a wonderful work environment. I want to take pride in my work, have
		others take pride in theirs, and together we can create beautifully working products. The majority of
		the jobs that I have interviewed for have been full stack developer positions, but I am open to front end,
		back end, or anything in between.

		<br><br>
	
		<b id="shade">Full Stack Development</b> is what I have been searching for in the job market. I enjoy
		seeing a project go from start to finish, each individual adding a little bit more to the project,
		and eventually you all create something you can be proud of. I'm a hard working individual who takes
		pride in who he is, where he works, what he does, and how he does it. I mainly focused on object
		oriented languages in college; C#, C++, Java, Python, and Visual Basic. The projects I worked on would
		quite often use a SQL database to store information for the program, on the user, and verify information
		for all users. The database classes offered at KSU were a great addition to my skillset. Offering unique
		ways of storing and accessing data, structuring databases to be normalized, and connecting the
		databases to the particular program written to use their data.
	
		<br><br>
	
		<b id="shade">The 2<sup>nd</sup> goal</b> would be to sustain growth within a company. I want to find a
		position where the management appreciates the employees, and in return they will receive hard work and
		respect. The work environment is a huge part of my job search. I don't want to be thrown into a position
		that I'm not qualified for, and be expected to sink or swim. I am extremely dead set on finding an entry
		level position that will help me grow, and allow me to grow with them through the addition of my skills.
	
		<br><br>
	
		<b id="shade">Growth</b> within a company will push me to progress my skills to new heights. I will have to
		constantly learn new skills, techniques, and code. In the end, the hard work and dedication will be completely
		worth it. I wanted to get into programming because I felt it would stimulate my mind in multiple different ways,
		and it does on many different levels; documentation, discussions, white boarding, design, coding, debugging,
		and release are all a combination of many different tasks and skills. Documentation, for example, requires a
		person to understand how to formulate a proper sentence, structure a paragraph, and style the document. The
		average person does not realize how many skills actually build upon each other to finally yield a software
		engineering position. Building skills, reputation, and work will eventually lead to my third goal.

		<br><br>
	
		<b id="shade">The 3<sup>rd</sup> goal</b> has to be find a suitable place to buy a home. This third goal
		will hopefully be achieved within 5 years. I do not want a whole lot out of life; a good paying job, a
		great family, wonderful pets, amazing food, and a place to call home. I hope to be able to take more vacations
		in the future to more distinct parts of the world gaining the experiences of a lifetime.
