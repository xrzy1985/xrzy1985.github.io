				<h2 id="shade">About</h2>
				<hr>
				<p class="lead">
					<b id="shade">I am a graduate</b> of Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a
					3.71 GPA majoring in computer science. I graduated from Dalton State College with an A.S. in computer science,
					and then proceeded to move to Kennesaw to attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a
					B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became
					a Kennesaw State University student. I followed the computer science curriculum while trying to focus on
					database design, <img id="img_border" src="images/profile.jpg" alt="James" style="float:right; width:250px; margin:25px;">
					software engineering, and various information technology classes.

					<br><br>

					<b id="shade">After graduation</b>, I was gifted with a large sum of money, and told to travel wherever I want for as
					long as I want. So, I ended up driving across the States to California and up the Eastern coast. I then
					took a flight to Italy to stay with some family, where I fell into the tourist role; rowing along the Venice canals,
					dreaming of the fights held in the Colosseum, and getting to actually see Mount Vesuvius from Pompeii was amazing. I
					ended up befriending a group of Australians while I was traveling southern Italy on a motorbike in Bari,
					who ended up offering me a place to stay outside of Melbourne. So, I took the next cheapest flight to Australia.
					My friend Steve took me all along the Gold Coast to watch people surf with great white sharks, we ate
					fresh fish I've never heard of, and we even drank a few cold ones with a wallaby. The mates and I traveled
					to New Zealand, off the North Island's Bay of Plenty specifically, to see the amazing views. We saw Auckland,
					Hobbiton, but camping deep in the Fiordland National Park was out of this world. Milford Sound is by far the
					most incredible view I've ever seen, outside of Margot Robbie. All in all, I had spent 3 months in Italy with
					my second Uncle, and six months living with Steve in Hopper's Crossing. I officially came back to the western
					world in October, and I still had some money left over. The plan was to arrive back in Texas, visit my cousin
					and her kids before coming back home, but I didn't want the ride to end yet. I ended up signing up for a bus trip
					along the Eastern coast of Mexico to the Ria Celestun National Park. I met some of the nicest people through
					my travels, and without those people I would have came home much sooner than I did. I will always cherish these
					memories, experiences, and try to build upon those each and every day.

				   <br><br>

					<b id="shade">After arriving home, </b>I ended up starting a small business that I operate out of my garage, called
					<a style="color: black;" href="https://noworrieswoodworking.github.io/">No Worries Wood Working</a>, and
					I really discovered my love for woodworking while I was in Australia. I helped Steve build an entirely new
					room along the North face of his home. I learned that I had the gift, and when I came home I put a lot of my
					efforts into developing the skills required to start. I ended up building small projects here and there,
					developing a great reputation among clients, and now I actually have to turn business down. Although, I do
					use the money to pay bills, I do the work because I love to, and I don't want to exhaust that option. I have
					also put a lot of effort into exploring additional languagees, technologies, and frameworks since I've been home
					that are related to computer science.

					<br><br>

					<b id="shade">Since being home, </b>I have focused a lot on learning new languages, techniques, and technologies. The first
					language I learned outside of college was C#, and I can't believe I waited this long to learn C#. C# is probably
					my favorite language to program in, and will hold a special place for me moving forward. I have started looking
					into mobile design, using Xamarin forms with C# to create a few small apps in the iOS environment. I have also
					touched on a bit of scripting using Unity to create my own copy of a few well known titles; space invaders, pac man,
					and super mario brothers is in production. I've also started learning a lot more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,
					AngularJS, and JQuery to name just a few. During college, I was focused on strictly object oriented programming, back
					end capabilities, and writing algorithms to suit my team's individual needs. The projects I worked on were always
					structured within the agile environment. The more complex projects I was apart of used the agile methodology further;
					breaking tasks down for individual roles within the methodology. The majority of larger projects I was apart of had
					one software engineer major to be our team lead, our professor being the product owner, and two computer science students
					assuming the developer roles. It wasn't until after graduation, that I started looking deeper into front end development.

					<br><br>

					<b id="shade">I realized soon after graduation, </b>that I wanted to become a full stack developer. I love being able to have
					input in all areas of development. I might not be the most skilled in certain areas, but collectively we all will bring
					value to the team in our own individual way. That is why I believe I want to find the right company or team, and
					progress my career with them specifically. I've had a few offers since January, but something has always felt off about
					the situations. I'm the kind of person who would rather wait for the right opportunity to present itself, then to jump
					into something I won't be happy with, and have to relocate within a few months or years.

				<h2 id="shade">Goals</h2>
				<hr>
				<p class="lead">

					<b id="shade">A little about me</b>, I'm not sure if I am your typical computer programmer, but I am definitely
					me. I love to exercise, and in return that leads me to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I like to go hiking, biking,
					or jogging along the country side in my free time. I also spend at least thirty minutes a day to play guitar, and
					learn a new chord, progression, or scale. The goal every day is to learn something new, challenge myself in different
					ways, and hopefully I will be a better person come tomorrow.

				  <br><br>

					<b id="shade">The 1<sup>st</sup> goal</b> is to obtain an entry level position within a great company.
					I took a year off to travel, and since I've been back in the states I haven't found the perfect fit. I
					want to secure a job with a wonderful work environment. I want to take pride in my work, have
					others take pride in theirs, and together we can create beautifully working products. The majority of
					the jobs that I have interviewed for have been full stack developer positions, but I am open to front end,
					back end, or anything in between.

				  <br><br>

					<b id="shade">Full Stack Development</b> is what I have been searching for in the job market. I enjoy
					seeing a project go from start to finish, each individual adding a little bit more to the project,
					and eventually you all create something you can be proud of. I'm a hard working individual who takes
					pride in who he is, where he works, what he does, and how he does it. I mainly focused on object
					oriented languages in college; C#, C++, Java, Python, and Visual Basic. The projects I worked on would
					quite often use a SQL database to store information for the program, on the user, and verify information
					for all users. The database classes offered at KSU were a great addition to my skillset. Offering unique
					ways of storing and accessing data, structuring databases to be normalized, and connecting the
					databases to the particular program written to use their data.

				  <br><br>

					<b id="shade">The 2<sup>nd</sup> goal</b> would be to sustain growth within a company. I want to find a
					position where the management appreciates the employees, and in return they will receive hard work and
					respect. The work environment is a huge part of my job search. I don't want to be thrown into a position
					that I'm not qualified for, and be expected to sink or swim. I am extremely dead set on finding an entry
					level position that will help me grow, and allow me to grow with them through the addition of my skills.

				  <br><br>

					<b id="shade">Growth</b> within a company will push me to progress my skills to new heights. I will have to
					constantly learn new skills, techniques, and code. In the end, the hard work and dedication will be completely
					worth it. I wanted to get into programming because I felt it would stimulate my mind in multiple different ways,
					and it does on many different levels; documentation, discussions, white boarding, design, coding, debugging,
					and release are all a combination of many different tasks and skills. Documentation, for example, requires a
					person to understand how to formulate a proper sentence, structure a paragraph, and style the document. The
					average person does not realize how many skills actually build upon each other to finally yield a software
					engineering position. Building skills, reputation, and work will eventually lead to my third goal.

				  <br><br>

					<b id="shade">The 3<sup>rd</sup> goal</b> has to be find a suitable place to buy a home. This third goal
					will hopefully be achieved within 5 years. I do not want a whole lot out of life; a good paying job, a
					great family, wonderful pets, amazing food, and a place to call home. I hope to be able to take more vacations
					in the future to more distinct parts of the world gaining the experiences of a lifetime.

								Freelance Project, I wanted to try and further my understanding of object oriented programming. I understood the

								project. Now I understand that an interface is a way of specifying the blueprint of methods that must be present
								within a class inheriting the interface, and now I can tell you that abstract classes are full of methods waiting
								to be overwritten. I have created Life: Animal: Person, Life: Animal: Dog, Life: Food objects, and more inside of
								this console application. I plan on updating regularly to include grids, locations within the grid, movement,
								fighting among different objects, and reflection methods to achieve dynamic object creation.

								and began recreating classic games. Unity helps further my progression with C#, scripting,
								and graphic design.

							<strong id="shade">GUI / UI Design</strong>
							<br>
							<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
							  A well built GUI/UI shouldn't need instructions if the design is
							  correctly built. I make efforts to decrease any learning curve
							  on the applications I've been apart of. I strive to increase the
							  aesthetics associated with the applications, create an interface
							  that requires no additional reading, and amplify the security of
							  the application to the best of my ability.
							</p>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
							<strong id="shade">Object Oriented Principles: </strong>
							<br>
							<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
								I have the knowledge to construct OOP functions, methods, various
								data structures, recursion, and so on. The languages I'm familiar
								with are C#, C++, Java, and Python. I plan on researching the model
								view control method to further my understanding of how web applications
								function on a larger scale.
							</p>
						</p>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
							<strong id="shade">Security</strong>
							<br>
							<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
							  A working knowledge of security standards is a good weapon for
							  any programmer to have. The ability to use encryption and decryption
							  algorithms to encrypt information, securely store sensitive information,
							  and decrypt the information without storing any plain text data on the
							  database. The importance of attempting to prevent phishing, SQL injection,
							  cross-site scripting, denial of service, and man in the middle attacks are
							  vital to any web application developer.
							</p>
						</p>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
							<strong id="shade">Web Applications</strong>
							<br>
							<p style="margin-left: 20px;">
							  Web applications are becoming the norm with information being
							  store progressively on the cloud. Programmers are opting to create web applications
							  that would not require any software downloads, instead websites are
							  being designed to work as fully fledged applications. Micro
							  frameworks, such as Django and Flask, utilize the model, view,
							  and control method to achieve their goal. The encryption standards
							  have been raised higher than ever before with 512 and 1024 bit
							  encryption techniques taking center stage.
