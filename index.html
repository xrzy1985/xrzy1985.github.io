        <h2 id="h2_heading">About</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
          <b id="shade">I am a graduate</b> of Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a
          3.71 GPA majoring in computer science. I graduated from Dalton State College with an A.S. in computer science,
          and then proceeded to move to Kennesaw to attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a
          B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became
          a Kennesaw State University student. I followed the computer science curriculum while trying to focus on
          database design, <img id="img_border" src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="James" style="float:right; width:250px; margin:25px;">
          software engineering, and various information technology classes.

          <br><br>

          <b id="shade">After graduation</b>, I was gifted with a large sum of money, and told to travel wherever I want for as
          long as I want. So, I ended up driving across the States to California and up the Eastern coast. I then
          took a flight to Italy to stay with some family, where I fell into the tourist role; rowing along the Venice canals,
          dreaming of the fights held in the Colosseum, and getting to actually see Mount Vesuvius from Pompeii was amazing. I
          ended up befriending a group of Australians while I was traveling southern Italy on a motorbike in Bari,
          who ended up offering me a place to stay outside of Melbourne. So, I took the next cheapest flight to Australia.
          My friend Steve took me all along the Gold Coast to watch people surf with great white sharks, we ate
          fresh fish I've never heard of, and we even drank a few cold ones with a wallaby. The mates and I traveled
          to New Zealand, off the North Island's Bay of Plenty specifically, to see the amazing views. We saw Auckland,
          Hobbiton, but camping deep in the Fiordland National Park was out of this world. Milford Sound is by far the
          most incredible view I've ever seen, outside of Margot Robbie. All in all, I had spent 3 months in Italy with
          my second Uncle, and six months living with Steve in Hopper's Crossing. I officially came back to the western
          world in October, and I still had some money left over. The plan was to arrive back in Texas, visit my cousin
          and her kids before coming back home, but I didn't want the ride to end yet. I ended up signing up for a bus trip
          along the Eastern coast of Mexico to the Ria Celestun National Park. I met some of the nicest people through
          my travels, and without those people I would have came home much sooner than I did. I will always cherish these
          memories, experiences, and try to build upon those each and every day.

         <br><br>

          <b id="shade">After arriving home, </b>I ended up starting a small business that I operate out of my garage, called
          <a style="color: black;" href="https://noworrieswoodworking.github.io/">No Worries Wood Working</a>, and
          I really discovered my love for woodworking while I was in Australia. I helped Steve build an entirely new
          room along the North face of his home. I learned that I had the gift, and when I came home I put a lot of my
          efforts into developing the skills required to start. I ended up building small projects here and there,
          developing a great reputation among clients, and now I actually have to turn business down. Although, I do
          use the money to pay bills, I do the work because I love to, and I don't want to exhaust that option. I have
          also put a lot of effort into exploring additional languagees, technologies, and frameworks since I've been home
          that are related to computer science.

          <br><br>

          <b id="shade">Since being home, </b>I have focused a lot on learning new languages, techniques, and technologies. The first
          language I learned outside of college was C#, and I can't believe I waited this long to learn C#. C# is probably
          my favorite language to program in, and will hold a special place for me moving forward. I have started looking
          into mobile design, using Xamarin forms with C# to create a few small apps in the iOS environment. I have also
          touched on a bit of scripting using Unity to create my own copy of a few well known titles; space invaders, pac man,
          and super mario brothers is in production. I've also started learning a lot more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,
          AngularJS, and JQuery to name just a few. During college, I was focused on strictly object oriented programming, back
          end capabilities, and writing algorithms to suit my team's individual needs. The projects I worked on were always
          structured within the agile environment. The more complex projects I was apart of used the agile methodology further;
          breaking tasks down for individual roles within the methodology. The majority of larger projects I was apart of had
          one software engineer major to be our team lead, our professor being the product owner, and two computer science students
          assuming the developer roles. It wasn't until after graduation, that I started looking deeper into front end development.

          <br><br>

          <b id="shade">I realized soon after graduation, </b>that I wanted to become a full stack developer. I love being able to have
          input in all areas of development. I might not be the most skilled in certain areas, but collectively we all will bring
          value to the team in our own individual way. That is why I believe I want to find the right company or team, and
          progress my career with them specifically. I've had a few offers since January, but something has always felt off about
          the situations. I'm the kind of person who would rather wait for the right opportunity to present itself, then to jump
          into something I won't be happy with, and have to relocate within a few months or years.

  <div class="row">

    <h2 id="h2_heading">Goals</h2>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">A little about me</b>, I'm not sure if I am your typical computer programmer, but I am definitely
      me. I love to exercise, and in return that leads me to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I like to go hiking, biking,
      or jogging along the country side in my free time. I also spend at least thirty minutes a day to play guitar, and
      learn a new chord, progression, or scale. The goal every day is to learn something new, challenge myself in different
      ways, and hopefully I will be a better person come tomorrow.

    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">The 1<sup>st</sup> goal</b> is to obtain an entry level position within a great company.
      I took a year off to travel, and since I've been back in the states I haven't found the perfect fit. I
      want to secure a job with a wonderful work environment. I want to take pride in my work, have
      others take pride in theirs, and together we can create beautifully working products. The majority of
      the jobs that I have interviewed for have been full stack developer positions, but I am open to front end,
      back end, or anything in between.

    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">Full Stack Development</b> is what I have been searching for in the job market. I enjoy
      seeing a project go from start to finish, each individual adding a little bit more to the project,
      and eventually you all create something you can be proud of. I'm a hard working individual who takes
      pride in who he is, where he works, what he does, and how he does it. I mainly focused on object
      oriented languages in college; C#, C++, Java, Python, and Visual Basic. The projects I worked on would
      quite often use a SQL database to store information for the program, on the user, and verify information
      for all users. The database classes offered at KSU were a great addition to my skillset. Offering unique
      ways of storing and accessing data, structuring databases to be normalized, and connecting the
      databases to the particular program written to use their data.
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">The 2<sup>nd</sup> goal</b> would be to sustain growth within a company. I want to find a
      position where the management appreciates the employees, and in return they will receive hard work and
      respect. The work environment is a huge part of my job search. I don't want to be thrown into a position
      that I'm not qualified for, and be expected to sink or swim. I am extremely dead set on finding an entry
      level position that will help me grow, and allow me to grow with them through the addition of my skills.

    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">Growth</b> within a company will push me to progress my skills to new heights. I will have to
      constantly learn new skills, techniques, and code. In the end, the hard work and dedication will be completely
      worth it. I wanted to get into programming because I felt it would stimulate my mind in multiple different ways,
      and it does on many different levels; documentation, discussions, white boarding, design, coding, debugging,
      and release are all a combination of many different tasks and skills. Documentation, for example, requires a
      person to understand how to formulate a proper sentence, structure a paragraph, and style the document. The
      average person does not realize how many skills actually build upon each other to finally yield a software
      engineering position. Building skills, reputation, and work will eventually lead to my third goal.

    </p>

    <br><br>

    <p>
      <b id="shade">The 3<sup>rd</sup> goal</b> has to be find a suitable place to buy a home. This third goal
      will hopefully be achieved within 5 years. I do not want a whole lot out of life; a good paying job, a
      great family, wonderful pets, amazing food, and a place to call home. I hope to be able to take more vacations
      in the future to more distinct parts of the world gaining the experiences of a lifetime.
