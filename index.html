          <br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">I am a graduate</b> of Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a
            3.71 GPA majoring in computer science. I graduated from Dalton State College with an A.S. in computer science,
            and then proceeded to move to Kennesaw to attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a
            B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became
            a Kennesaw State University student. I followed the computer science curriculum while trying to focus on
            database design, <img id="img_border" src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="James" style="float:right; width:250px; margin:25px;">
            software engineering, and various information technology classes.

            <br><br>

            <b id="shade">After graduation</b>, I was gifted with a large sum of money, and told to travel wherever I want for as
            long as I want. So, I ended up driving across the States to California and up the Eastern coast. I then
            took a flight to Italy to stay with some family, where I fell into the tourist role; rowing along the Venice canals,
            dreaming of the fights held in the Colosseum, and getting to actually see Mount Vesuvius from Pompeii was amazing. I
            ended up befriending a group of Australians while I was traveling southern Italy on a motorbike in Bari,
            who ended up offering me a place to stay outside of Melbourne. So, I took the next cheapest flight to Australia.
            My friend Steve took me all along the Gold Coast to watch people surf with great white sharks, we ate
            fresh fish I've never heard of, and we even drank a few cold ones with a wallaby. The mates and I traveled
            to New Zealand, off the North Island's Bay of Plenty specifically, to see the amazing views. We saw Auckland,
            Hobbiton, but camping deep in the Fiordland National Park was out of this world. Milford Sound is by far the
            most incredible view I've ever seen, outside of Margot Robbie. All in all, I had spent 3 months in Italy with
            my second Uncle, and six months living with Steve in Hopper's Crossing. I officially came back to the western
            world in October, and I still had some money left over. The plan was to arrive back in Texas, visit my cousin
            and her kids before coming back home, but I didn't want the ride to end yet. I ended up signing up for a bus trip
            along the Eastern coast of Mexico to the Ria Celestun National Park. I met some of the nicest people through
            my travels, and without those people I would have came home much sooner than I did. I will always cherish these
            memories, experiences, and try to build upon those each and every day.

           <br><br>

            <b id="shade">After arriving home, </b>I ended up starting a small business that I operate out of my garage, called
            <a style="color: black;" href="https://noworrieswoodworking.github.io/">No Worries Wood Working</a>, and
            I really discovered my love for woodworking while I was in Australia. I helped Steve build an entirely new
            room along the North face of his home. I learned that I had the gift, and when I came home I put a lot of my
            efforts into developing the skills required to start. I ended up building small projects here and there,
            developing a great reputation among clients, and now I actually have to turn business down. Although, I do
            use the money to pay bills, I do the work because I love to, and I don't want to exhaust that option. I have
            also put a lot of effort into exploring additional languagees, technologies, and frameworks since I've been home
            that are related to computer science.

            <br><br>

            <b id="shade">Since being home, </b>I have focused a lot on learning new languages, techniques, and technologies. The first
            language I learned outside of college was C#, and I can't believe I waited this long to learn C#. C# is probably
            my favorite language to program in, and will hold a special place for me moving forward. I have started looking
            into mobile design, using Xamarin forms with C# to create a few small apps in the iOS environment. I have also
            touched on a bit of scripting using Unity to create my own copy of a few well known titles; space invaders, pac man,
            and super mario brothers is in production. I've also started learning a lot more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,
            AngularJS, and JQuery to name just a few. During college, I was focused on strictly object oriented programming, back
            end capabilities, and writing algorithms to suit my team's individual needs. The projects I worked on were always
            structured within the agile environment. The more complex projects I was apart of used the agile methodology further;
            breaking tasks down for individual roles within the methodology. The majority of larger projects I was apart of had
            one software engineer major to be our team lead, our professor being the product owner, and two computer science students
            assuming the developer roles. It wasn't until after graduation, that I started looking deeper into front end development.

            <br><br>

            <b id="shade">I realized soon after graduation, </b>that I wanted to become a full stack developer. I love being able to have
            input in all areas of development. I might not be the most skilled in certain areas, but collectively we all will bring
            value to the team in our own individual way. That is why I believe I want to find the right company or team, and
            progress my career with them specifically. I've had a few offers since January, but something has always felt off about
            the situations. I'm the kind of person who would rather wait for the right opportunity to present itself, then to jump
            into something I won't be happy with, and have to relocate within a few months or years.

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">A little about me</b>, I'm not sure if I am your typical computer programmer, but I am definitely
            me. I love to exercise, and in return that leads me to a healthier diet and lifestyle. I like to go hiking, biking,
            or jogging along the country side in my free time. I also spend at least thirty minutes a day to play guitar, and
            learn a new chord, progression, or scale. The goal every day is to learn something new, challenge myself in different
            ways, and hopefully I will be a better person come tomorrow.

          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">The 1<sup>st</sup> goal</b> is to obtain an entry level position within a great company.
            I took a year off to travel, and since I've been back in the states I haven't found the perfect fit. I
            want to secure a job with a wonderful work environment. I want to take pride in my work, have
            others take pride in theirs, and together we can create beautifully working products. The majority of
            the jobs that I have interviewed for have been full stack developer positions, but I am open to front end,
            back end, or anything in between.

          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">Full Stack Development</b> is what I have been searching for in the job market. I enjoy
            seeing a project go from start to finish, each individual adding a little bit more to the project,
            and eventually you all create something you can be proud of. I'm a hard working individual who takes
            pride in who he is, where he works, what he does, and how he does it. I mainly focused on object
            oriented languages in college; C#, C++, Java, Python, and Visual Basic. The projects I worked on would
            quite often use a SQL database to store information for the program, on the user, and verify information
            for all users. The database classes offered at KSU were a great addition to my skillset. Offering unique
            ways of storing and accessing data, structuring databases to be normalized, and connecting the
            databases to the particular program written to use their data.
          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">The 2<sup>nd</sup> goal</b> would be to sustain growth within a company. I want to find a
            position where the management appreciates the employees, and in return they will receive hard work and
            respect. The work environment is a huge part of my job search. I don't want to be thrown into a position
            that I'm not qualified for, and be expected to sink or swim. I am extremely dead set on finding an entry
            level position that will help me grow, and allow me to grow with them through the addition of my skills.

          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">Growth</b> within a company will push me to progress my skills to new heights. I will have to
            constantly learn new skills, techniques, and code. In the end, the hard work and dedication will be completely
            worth it. I wanted to get into programming because I felt it would stimulate my mind in multiple different ways,
            and it does on many different levels; documentation, discussions, white boarding, design, coding, debugging,
            and release are all a combination of many different tasks and skills. Documentation, for example, requires a
            person to understand how to formulate a proper sentence, structure a paragraph, and style the document. The
            average person does not realize how many skills actually build upon each other to finally yield a software
            engineering position. Building skills, reputation, and work will eventually lead to my third goal.

          </p>

          <br><br>

          <p>
            <b id="shade">The 3<sup>rd</sup> goal</b> has to be find a suitable place to buy a home. This third goal
            will hopefully be achieved within 5 years. I do not want a whole lot out of life; a good paying job, a
            great family, wonderful pets, amazing food, and a place to call home. I hope to be able to take more vacations
            in the future to more distinct parts of the world gaining the experiences of a lifetime.

                    Freelance Project, I originally wrote the application for Freight Kitchen & Tap's
                    servers to use to simplify the tip out each server will owe at the end of their shift, but I
                    never received payment to publish the application on any app store. So, the application
                    is an unused finished project.

                  <b id="shade">Purpose: </b>
                    Freelance Project, I wanted to try and further my understanding of object oriented programming. I understood the
                    idea behind public, protected, and private variables, but until this project, I haven't used protected or private
                    variables much, if any. The differences between an interface and an abstract class always confused me until this
                    project. Now I understand that an interface is a way of specifying the blueprint of methods that must be present
                    within a class inheriting the interface, and now I can tell you that abstract classes are full of methods waiting
                    to be overwritten. I have created Life: Animal: Person, Life: Animal: Dog, Life: Food objects, and more inside of
                    this console application. I plan on updating regularly to include grids, locations within the grid, movement,
                    fighting among different objects, and reflection methods to achieve dynamic object creation.

              cross-site scripting, denial of service, and man in the middle attacks are
              vital to any web application developer.

              Web applications are becoming the norm with information being
              store progressively on the cloud. Programmers are opting to create web applications
              that would not require any software downloads, instead websites are
              being designed to work as fully fledged applications. Micro
              frameworks, such as Django and Flask, utilize the model, view,
              and control method to achieve their goal. The encryption standards
              have been raised higher than ever before with 512 and 1024 bit
              encryption techniques taking center stage.
