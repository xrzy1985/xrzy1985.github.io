        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            <img src="/images/profile.jpg" alt="James" style="float:right; margin-left:15px;">
            <b>I am a graduate</b> of Kennesaw State University's College of Computing and Software Engineering with a
            3.71 GPA majoring in computer science. I graduated from Dalton State College with an A.S. in computer science,
            and then proceeded to move to Kennesaw to attend Southern Polytechnic State University to start working on a
            B.S. in computer science. SPSU was eventually merged with Kennesaw State University, and that is how I became
            a Kennesaw State University student. I followed the computer science curriculum while trying to focus on
            database design, software engineering, and various information technology classes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>After graduation</b>, I was gifted with a large sum of money, and told to travel wherever I want for as
            long as I want. So, I ended up driving across the States to California and up the Eastern coast. I then
            took a flight to Italy to stay with some family, where I fell into the tourist role; rowing along the Venice canals,
            dreaming of the fights held in the Colosseum, and getting to actually see Mount Vesuvius from Pompeii was amazing. I
            ended up befriending a group of Australians while I was traveling southern Italy on a motorbike in Bari,
            who ended up offering me a place to stay outside of Melbourne. So, I took the next cheapest flight to Australia.
            My friend Steve took me all along the Gold Coast to watch people surf with great white sharks, we ate
            fresh fish I've never heard of, and we even drank a few cold ones with a wallaby. The mates and I traveled
            to New Zealand, off the North Island's Bay of Plenty specifically, to see the amazing views. We saw Auckland,
            Hobbiton, but camping deep in the Fiordland National Park was out of this world. Milford Sound is by far the
            most incredible view I've ever seen, outside of Margot Robbie. All in all, I had spent 3 months in Italy with
            my second Uncle, and six months living with Steve in Hopper's Crossing. I officially came back to the western
            world in October, and I still had some money left over. The plan was to arrive back in Texas, visit my cousin
            and her kids before coming back home, but I didn't want the ride to end yet. I ended up signing up for a bus trip
            along the Eastern coast of Mexico to the Ria Celestun National Park. I met some of the nicest people through
            my travels, and without those people I would have came home much sooner than I did. I will always cherish these
            memories, experiences, and try to build upon those each and every day.
        </p>

       <hr>

        <p>
            <b>After arriving home, </b>I ended up starting a small business that I operate out of my garage, called
            <a style="color: black;" href="https://noworrieswoodworking.github.io/">No Worries Wood Working</a>, and
            I really discovered my love for woodworking while I was in Australia. I helped Steve build an entirely new
            room along the North face of his home. I learned that I had the gift, and when I came home I put a lot of my
            efforts into developing the skills required to start. I ended up building small projects here and there,
            developing a great reputation among clients, and now I actually have to turn business down. Although, I do
            use the money to pay bills, I do the work because I love to, and I don't want to exhaust that option. I have
            also put a lot of effort into exploring additional languagees, technologies, and frameworks since I've been home
            that are related to computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Since being home, </b>I have focused a lot on learning new languages, techniques, and technologies. The first
            language I learned outside of college was C#, and I can't believe I waited this long to learn C#. C# is probably
            my favorite language to program in, and will hold a special place for me moving forward. I have started looking
            into mobile design, using Xamarin forms with C# to create a few small apps in the iOS environment. I have also
            touched on a bit of scripting using Unity to create my own copy of a few well known titles; space invaders, pac man,
            and super mario brothers is in production. I've also started learning a lot more about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,
            AngularJS, and JQuery to name just a few. During college, I was focused on strictly object oriented programming with
            very little front end development. The projects I was apart of always seemed to have a graphic designer, software engineer major,
            and a few developers. It wasn't until after graduation, that I started to look into front end development more.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>I realized soon after graduation, </b>that I wanted to become a full stack developer. I love being able to have
          input in all areas of development. I might not be the most skilled in certain areas, but collectively we all will bring
          value to the team in our own individual way. That is why I believe I want to find the right company or team, and
          progress my career with them specifically. I've had a few offers since January, but something has always felt off about
          the situations. I'm the kind of person who would rather wait for the right opportunity to present itself, then to jump
          into something I won't be happy with, and have to relocate within a few months or years.
